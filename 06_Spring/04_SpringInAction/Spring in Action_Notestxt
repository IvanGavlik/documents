Spring in Action

At its core, Spring offers a container, often referred to as the Spring application con-
text, that creates and manages application components. These components, or beans,
are wired together inside the Spring application context to make a complete applica-
tion, much like bricks, mortar, timber, nails, plumbing, and wiring are bound together
to make a house.

Rather than have components create and maintain the lifecycle of other beans
that they depend on, a dependency-injected application relies on a separate entity
(the container) to create and maintain all components and inject those into the beans
that need them.
