See https://github.com/joeldenning/import-map-overrides. You do `npm install` and `npm start`. Then you go to a deployed environment and set up an override so that it uses your local version of the micro-frontend instead of the deployed version.


For shared dependencies, see https://single-spa.js.org/docs/recommended-setup#shared-dependencies

For design consistency, create a shared style guide module and/or choose a design system such as bootstrap. See https://single-spa.js.org/docs/microfrontends-concept#types-of-microfrontends and https://github.com/react-microfrontends/shared-dependencies.

Webpack 5 Module Federation is a massive unlock, single-spa provides a strong orchestration layer, Next.js with a custom AppShell, and yarn workspaces that serve as sub-apps is a robust design pattern, which can enable scale and can integrate with Module Federation if or when needed. Micro is another fantastic tool for creating an ingress to route a user to the correct micro-frontend as well. Leveraging monorepos keeps code organized but will still have the pitfall of having only one master branch, bottlenecking deployments. Semantic-release is vital for micro-frontend architecture, where semver plays an important role in the scalability and reliable code distribution.
