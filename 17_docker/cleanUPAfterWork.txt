Docker doesn’t automatically clean up containers or application packages for you.
When you quit Docker Desktop (or stop the Docker service), all your containers stop
and they don’t use any CPU or memory, but if you want to, you can clean up at the
end of every chapter by running this command:
docker container rm -f $(docker container ls -aq)
And if you want to reclaim disk space after following the exercises, you can run this
command:
docker image rm -f $(docker image ls)
