I followed 2 resources for that. First one was System Design Interview book by Alex xu ( Hands down the best resource available ). The book is in 2 parts and will cover almost every topic out there.

For practicing the LLD Questions and design patterns, I followed Shreyansh Jain playlist on YouTube ( He has some of the best content explained in a very very simple way with lots of examples )
