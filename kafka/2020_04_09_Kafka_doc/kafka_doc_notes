Topics
A topic is a category or feed name to which records are published
For each topic, the Kafka cluster maintains a partitioned log

Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of records that is continually
appended toâ€”a structured commit log. The records in the partitions are each
assigned a sequential id number called the offset that uniquely identifies
each record within the partition. Every consumer have his offset

Consumers
Consumers label themselves with a consumer group name, 
and each record published to a topic is delivered to one consumer instance 
within each subscribing consumer group.
