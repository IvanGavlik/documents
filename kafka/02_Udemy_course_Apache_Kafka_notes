Topic go to Log File can have more Partitions can have more Replicas 
can have more Segments
						
Topic - place where you group msg
- table in db msg is row

Topic Partitions
break the msg insise topic in more files.
Kafka will create x direcotires for x partions

Replicion Facotor
- how many copies of msg for each partion
- Partitions (5) x Repliction(3) = Number od Replicas (15)
		for each partion create 3 repicas (kopijes) = 15 partions (15 direcotires)
		for each parÅ¾ group (of 3) one is leader two are copies
in dir kafa do not create one file but more them -> there are called 
log segments
if the segement file max size is recived kafa create new segement file

in segmet each msg is identified by number (16 bit) called offset
when new segemnt is created it have the name of first offest 
new segmet offest cout starst where previus was finished

each msg have: topic name, partion number, offset number, 
timestap (time index)

Kafa Cluster Architecture
broker -> server
cluster -> group of serevers that work for same goal
Apache Zookeoer maintains brokers inside clusters 
(every broker have id)
one broker in cluster is also a controller responible for 
admin task on others brokers inside cluster

Work Distributions
broker is responible for managing partions
Ex: 
	if you have 10 partitons and replica factor 3 -> totoal 30 partitoins
	if they are 5 brokers kafkas goal is even distribution and fault tolerance
