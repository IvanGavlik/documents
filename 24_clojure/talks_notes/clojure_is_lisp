Clojure
* dynamice
* code as data 
* reader 
* small core
* sequences
* syntactic abstraction 

Dynamic development
* REPL (read eval print loop)
* define and fix functions on the fly 
* load and compile code at runtime
* introspection
* interactive env (look at namespaces)

Data Structures
* List singly linked grow at front
* Vector indeced access grow at end
* Maps
* Sets
* all nests
