Intro 

Clojure program 
- no variables
- no mutable state 
- no branches

Clojure is a functional language but not a pure functional language

Functions are first-class objects. That is, functions can be created at
runtime, passed around, returned, and in general, used like any other
datatype,
	A higher-order function is a function that takes functions as arguments and/or returns functions as results

Immutable data structures are inherently thread safe.

Functions are pure; that is, they have no side effects.

Clojure is a Lisp.

Reliance on the JVM provides a standard library and a deploy-
ment platform with great reach.

Concurent programming
When you need references to mutable data, Clojure protects them
via software transactional memory (STM)

Clojure gives you clean, simple, direct access to Java
