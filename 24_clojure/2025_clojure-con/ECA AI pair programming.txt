ECA: AI pair programming in your editor - Dallo 

open source project eca / Rationale

have metrics

why ai for development
- LLMs test generator based on weight (there is no magic)
- tool not a problem solver -> you should still need to think

current state of ai for developmemnt
- I dont want to be vibe coding 
- tomorrow will probably change, will stay  user <-> LLM
- loot of ai cli tools and new editors
	- you can end up vendor locked 
- local model are getting better - are they the future?
- LLMs gets better, UX not really
